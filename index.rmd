## Plainly (as best you can) state your variables




\begin{equation}
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots \beta_p X_p + \epsilon
\end{equation}

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Aggregated or Microdata?  (counties/nations/households vs. individuals) 	| Is there a geographic  component to your topic?  (U.S., Sub-Saharan Africa, India) 	| Do you want a data for a  specific time period?  (1980-2000, 1930-1960) 	| How often do you want measures  for your variables?  (every year, every ten years, monthly, quarterly) 	|


## Providers

| Researchers                                                    	| Government Agencies                                                                                                                                                                       	| NGO/IGOs                                                                                                                                     	| Research Organizations                                                                                                   	|
|----------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Are there people you know who are doing this kind of research? 	| Think about government agencies - is the request for some official statistics or data that they'd be likely to collect and publish? (Department of Energy, CDC, Census Bureau) 	| Are there councils or interest organizations devoted to the topic that might collect data independently? (World Bank, OECD) 	| Would any specific research organizations be interested in the topic? (Pew, Roper, Gallup, ACLU ) 	|





## The 80/20 "Rule"

> It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. 


-Dasu and Johnson


## Tidy Data

> “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” 

– Leo Tolstoy


> “Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.” 

– Hadley Wickham




##Tidy Data = Happy Data

Tidy Data has the following attributes:

Each variable forms a column and contains values

Each observation forms a row

## Reaching out

http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/libraries/data-lab


## Rest of class

1. Think about your topic or topics and find out what JEL Classification it maps to. 

2. Using a library database like EconLit or a database of your choice, identify at least one article that you might use

3. Using one a data resource like Data Planet or ICPSR, identify a dataset or data source that you might se

4. Check-in with any questions :)
